# Machine learning for optimizing complex site-specific management
by Yuji Saikai

**Abstract**

Despite the promise of precision agriculture (PA) for increasing the efficiency of crop production by implementing site-specific management, farmers remain skeptical and its utilization rate is lower than expected. A major cause is a lack of concrete approaches to higher profitability. When PA involves many variables in both controlled management and monitored environment, optimal site-specific management for such high-dimensional cropping systems is considerably more complex than the traditional low-dimensional cases widely studied in the existing literature, calling for a paradigm shift in optimization of site-specific management. We propose an algorithmic approach that enables each farmer to efficiently learn their own site-specific management through on-farm experiments. We demonstrate its performance in simulated environments. Our results show that, for example, the learned site-specific management from 5-year experiments generates $43/ha higher profits with 25 kg/ha less nitrogen fertilizer in one scenario with 150 management variables and $40/ha higher profits with 56 kg/ha less nitrogen fertilizer in another scenario with 864 management variables than the benchmark uniform management. Thus, complex site-specific management can be learned very efficiently, which is indeed more profitable and environmentally sustainable than uniform management.
